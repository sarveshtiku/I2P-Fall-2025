# üß© ContextLink ‚Äì A Universal AI Memory Fabric

ContextLink is a **neutral context layer** that enables seamless switching between LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.) without losing continuity.  
It captures, compresses, and rehydrates conversations across models, making context **portable, collaborative, and sustainable**.

## üîë Core Components

### 1. Conversation State Manager (Memory Layer)
- Central one-stop store for all conversation data: transcripts, metadata, embeddings, and compressed summaries.  
- Independent of any specific LLM provider ‚Üí portable across GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.  
- **Database Options**:
  - Postgres + pgvector (semantic search + retrieval)  
  - Pinecone or Weaviate for managed vector DB  
- Supports both raw history and summarized/embedding views for efficient re-hydration.  

### 2. Model Switching Layer (Router)
- Abstract API to connect multiple LLM providers.  
- Each provider has its own adapter:  
  - OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, etc.)  
  - Anthropic (Claude 3.x)  
  - Google Gemini  
  - Local models (via HuggingFace / vLLM)  
- On switch, router rehydrates conversation context from memory ‚Üí reformats ‚Üí passes to the new model.  

### 3. Context Reconstruction (Prompt Engineering Layer)
- Normalizes conversation history into the format each LLM expects (system/user/assistant roles).  
- Compresses history with summarization + retrieval augmentation to fit smaller context windows.  
- Ensures continuity of reasoning across heterogeneous models.  

### 4. UI / Interaction Layer
- Chat-style web app.  
- Toggle/dropdown to switch models on the fly.  
- Shows which model is active at any moment.  
- Option to compare outputs side-by-side across multiple models.  

### 5. Collaboration Layer
- Shared workspaces where teams co-own **Context Packs** (versioned bundles of transcripts, notes, and references).  
- **Deduplicated Memory Graph**: collaborators reference the same nodes instead of duplicating history.  
- **Access Control & Provenance**: role-based permissions, redaction, and full author/source tracking.  
- **Collab Tools & Cost Controls**: co-editing, review flows (like Git PRs), project quotas, and shared-cache savings.  

### 6. Sustainability & Emissions Layer
- **Carbon-Aware Usage**: every prompt tracks estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions alongside token cost.  
- **Auto-Optimization**: suggests prompt/token reductions with auto-change features to minimize emissions.  
- **Dashboard & Leaderboard**:
  - Compare efficiency across models/users (cost, latency, emissions).  
  - Enterprises: leaderboards by team/project, benchmarked on sustainability + spend.  
  - Individuals: personal dashboards with gamified progress.  

**Business Model**:  
- **Enterprises**: free ‚Äúcarbon usage‚Äù credit (by grams of CO‚ÇÇ), then billed per gram over quota.  
- **Individuals**: freemium plan ‚Üí basic free tier with upsell to paid credits.

## üîÑ Workflow Example
1. User chats with GPT-4 ‚Üí conversation logged in DB.  
2. Switch to Claude ‚Üí router fetches N past messages (or a summary).  
3. Context is reformatted into Claude‚Äôs input schema.  
4. Claude generates a response ‚Üí added back into unified conversation history.  
5. In a team workspace, collaborators co-edit the same Context Pack.  
6. Sustainability layer tracks tokens + CO‚ÇÇ usage, suggesting reductions if wasteful.  
7. Dashboards show performance metrics, and enterprises monitor team-wide carbon budgets.

## üõ† Tech Stack Suggestions

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node)  
- **Conversation DB**:  
  - MongoDB (flexible JSON)  
  - OR Postgres + pgvector (if semantic search needed)  
- **LLM Connectors**:  
  - OpenAI API  
  - Anthropic API  
  - Google Gemini API  
  - HuggingFace Inference / vLLM  
- **Memory Handling**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom lightweight memory module  
- **Frontend**: React.js with model-switching toggle + side-by-side comparison view  
- **Sustainability Tracking**: CO‚ÇÇ estimation APIs + analytics dashboards (Plotly / Chart.js)

## ‚ú® Advanced Features (Future Roadmap)
- Auto-context compression ‚Üí preserve very long chats.  
- Hybrid outputs ‚Üí request multiple models at once for direct comparisons.  
- Fine-grained memory control ‚Üí user decides which parts of history to carry over.  
- Cost + Carbon Optimization ‚Üí auto-route trivial queries to cheaper/greener models.  
- Consensus Synthesizer ‚Üí merge multiple model outputs with flagged disagreements.  
- Context Drift Alerts ‚Üí detect when a conversation diverges from the approved shared pack.
