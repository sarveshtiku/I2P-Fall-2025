# 🧠 ContextQ – Task-Aware LLM Orchestration with Portable Context

**ContextQ** is a universal orchestration layer for large language models (LLMs), enabling intelligent task decomposition and seamless context sharing across heterogeneous models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLaMA.

At its core, ContextQ uses a **master LLM** to break complex prompts into subtasks, routing each to the most optimized model for that domain—without losing conversational continuity. It ensures **context is portable, rehydrated, and shareable** across systems and collaborators.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧩 Context-Aware Task Decomposition
- Use a master LLM to break down complex problems into structured subtasks.
- Route each subtask to the most appropriate, optimized model.
- Stitch results together with full traceability and context continuity.

### 🔄 Seamless Model Switching
- Switch between models mid-task or mid-conversation without losing context.
- Automatically reformats and rehydrates context into the target model's expected schema.

### 🗂 Context Packs & Shareability
- Encapsulate conversation history, metadata, and summaries into **Context Packs**.
- Shareable across projects, people, and LLMs.
- Enables collaborative workflows with memory deduplication and context continuity.

### 👥 Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Coordinate multiple LLMs to contribute to a single task or workflow.
- Ideal for teams needing dynamic model composition based on skill, speed, or cost.

## 🛠 Core Components

### 1. Conversation Memory Layer
- Stores raw and summarized conversation history.
- Compatible with:
  - `Postgres + pgvector` (recommended)
  - `Pinecone` or `Weaviate` (for managed vector DBs)
- Embedding support for semantic search and efficient rehydration.

### 2. Model Router
- Adapters for:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1)
  - Anthropic (Claude 3.x)
  - Google Gemini
  - Local models (HuggingFace, vLLM, Ollama)
- Automatically routes subtasks to the best-suited model based on configuration or LLM suggestions.

### 3. Prompt Transformation Layer
- Normalizes role formats (system/user/assistant) across providers.
- Compresses long histories and reconstructs prompts for limited context windows.
- Ensures consistent context across heterogeneous models.

### 4. UI / Interaction Layer
- Web-based chat UI with:
  - Model switcher
  - Active model badge
  - Optional side-by-side model comparison

### 5. Context Collaboration Layer
- Share Context Packs with teams or collaborators.
- Memory Graph Deduplication to avoid duplicated history across users.
- Supports editing, version control, and shared context evolution.

## 🧠 Example Workflow

1. User sends a high-level request to ContextQ.
2. A master LLM decomposes the request into subtasks:
   - 🧠 Summarization → Gemini  
   - 💻 Code generation → Codellama  
   - 🧐 Analysis → Claude
3. Each subtask is routed with relevant context to its target model.
4. Responses are unified and returned as a coherent response or workflow.
5. The resulting Context Pack is saved, shared, or further iterated upon by a team.
