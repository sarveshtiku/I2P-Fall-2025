# ðŸ§© ContextLink â€“ A Universal AI Memory Fabric

## ðŸ”‘ Core Components

### 1. Conversation State Manager (Memory Layer)
- Central store for all conversation data: transcripts, metadata, embeddings, and compressed summaries.
- Independent of any specific LLM provider â†’ portable across GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.
- Database options:
  - **Postgres + pgvector** (semantic search + retrieval)
  - **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** for managed vector DB
- Supports both raw history and summarized/embedding views for efficient re-hydration.

### 2. Model Switching Layer (Router)
- Abstract API to connect multiple LLM providers.
- Each provider has its own adapter:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, etc.)
  - Anthropic (Claude 3.x)
  - Google Gemini
  - Local models (via HuggingFace / vLLM)
- On switch, router rehydrates conversation context from memory â†’ reformats â†’ passes to the new model.

### 3. Context Reconstruction (Prompt Engineering Layer)
- Normalizes conversation history into the format each LLM expects (e.g., system/user/assistant roles).
- Compresses history with summarization + retrieval augmentation to fit within smaller context windows.
- Ensures continuity of reasoning across heterogeneous models.

### 4. UI / Interaction Layer
- Chat-style web app.
- Toggle/dropdown to switch models on the fly.
- Shows which model is active at any moment.
- Option to **compare outputs side-by-side** across multiple models.

### 5. Collaboration Layer
- Enables teams and research groups to share conversation memory without duplicating storage or tokens.
- Co-editing prompts, inline comments, and review flows for context changes (like Git PRs).
- Deduplicated Memory Graph such that contributors reference the same nodes instead of copying data.
- Every memory node tracks author, timestamp, and source; model outputs cite shared nodes.
- Shared cache hits donâ€™t rebill collaborators; project-level quotas and budgets for cost-optimization.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Example
1. User chats with **GPT-4** â†’ conversation logged in DB.
2. Switch to **Claude** â†’ router fetches N past messages (or a summary).
3. Context is reformatted into Claudeâ€™s input schema.
4. Claude generates a response â†’ added back into the unified conversation history.
5. User can switch again to Gemini or a local LLaMA instance, without losing continuity.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack Suggestions

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node)
- **Conversation DB**:
  - MongoDB (flexible JSON)  
  - OR Postgres + pgvector (if semantic search needed)
- **LLM Connectors**: OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google Gemini API, HuggingFace Inference, vLLM
- **Memory Handling**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom lightweight memory module
- **Frontend**: React.js with a model-switching toggle + side-by-side comparison view

---

## âœ¨ Advanced Features (Future Roadmap)
- **Auto-context compression** â†’ preserve very long chats.
- **Hybrid outputs** â†’ request multiple models at once for direct comparisons.
- **Fine-grained memory control** â†’ user decides which parts of history to carry over.
- **Cost optimization** â†’ route trivial queries to cheaper models automatically.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Question
Is this built as:
- **Personal Developer Tool** â†’ lightweight, single-user, rapid prototyping
- **Platform for Others** â†’ multi-user, production-ready, enterprise-grade routing

This choice affects how robust the **memory fabric** and **router** need to be.
